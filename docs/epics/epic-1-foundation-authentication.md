# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

## Epic Goal
Establish the core platform infrastructure and secure multi-tenant authentication system that enables all subsequent Synfind features while ensuring robust security and scalability from day one.

## Epic Description

**Context:**
This is the foundational epic for Synfind (ScholaryHub), a greenfield academic publishing management platform. The platform will serve multiple publisher organizations (multi-tenant) with role-based access for Publishers, Editors, Reviewers, and Authors.

**Technology Foundation:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- T3 Stack (tRPC, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth v5)
- MongoDB Atlas for multi-tenant data storage
- Vercel deployment with global edge functions

**What This Epic Delivers:**
A fully functional authentication and tenant management system that supports:
- Multi-provider authentication (Google, ORCID, institutional SSO)
- Multi-tenant publisher organization management
- Role-based access control across all user types
- Secure session management and tenant isolation
- Foundation for all subsequent platform features

## Success Criteria
- [ ] New users can authenticate via Google/ORCID within 30 seconds
- [ ] Publisher organizations maintain complete data isolation
- [ ] Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized access across tenants
- [ ] System supports unlimited concurrent users with sub-200ms response times
- [ ] All authentication flows meet GDPR and academic privacy requirements

## Stories

### Story 1.1: T3 Stack Project Initialization
**Goal:** Set up the foundational Next.js 15 T3 Stack project with all required dependencies and development environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] T3 Stack initialized with Next.js 15, TypeScript, tRPC, Tailwind CSS
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas connection configured and tested
- [ ] Basic project structure established with proper folder organization
- [ ] Development environment documented in README
- [ ] All team members can run project locally within 5 minutes
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code quality

**Technical Requirements:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- tRPC v10 with type-safe API routes
- Tailwind CSS with custom academic design tokens
- MongoDB connection with proper error handling

### Story 1.2: NextAuth v5 Multi-Provider Configuration
**Goal:** Implement secure authentication with Google and ORCID providers, supporting academic workflow requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Google OAuth integration with academic email domain validation
- [ ] ORCID OAuth integration for researcher authentication
- [ ] Secure session management with database session storage
- [ ] Automatic account linking for users with multiple auth methods
- [ ] Sign-out functionality with session cleanup
- [ ] Authentication state management across app

**Technical Requirements:**
- NextAuth v5 configuration with database session adapter
- OAuth providers configured with appropriate scopes
- Session security with CSRF protection
- Redirect handling for authenticated/unauthenticated states

### Story 1.3: Multi-Tenant Database Architecture
**Goal:** Implement tenant-isolated database schemas ensuring complete data separation between publisher organizations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Publisher organization model with tenant isolation
- [ ] User-to-tenant association with role mapping
- [ ] Database queries automatically scoped to tenant context
- [ ] Data isolation verification through automated tests
- [ ] Migration scripts for schema updates
- [ ] Database indexing for optimal query performance

**Technical Requirements:**
- MongoDB collections with tenant-aware schema design
- Prisma ORM with multi-tenant query patterns
- Database connection pooling optimized for serverless
- Automated testing for cross-tenant data leakage prevention

### Story 1.4: Role-Based Access Control System
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive permission system supporting Publisher Admin, Editor-in-Chief, Associate Editor, Reviewer, and Author roles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Role hierarchy properly enforced (Publisher Admin > Editor-in-Chief > Associate Editor)
- [ ] Permission-based route protection (HOCs and middleware)
- [ ] UI components dynamically show/hide based on user permissions
- [ ] API endpoints validate permissions before data access
- [ ] Role assignment interface for Publisher Admins
- [ ] Permission inheritance working correctly

**Technical Requirements:**
- RBAC middleware for tRPC procedures
- React hooks for permission-based UI rendering
- Next.js middleware for route-level protection
- Permission definitions aligned with academic publishing workflows

### Story 1.5: User Onboarding & Tenant Selection
**Goal:** Create intuitive onboarding flow that guides new users through tenant selection and role assignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New users guided through organization selection/creation
- [ ] Invitation-based organization joining with email verification
- [ ] Role request workflow for pending user access
- [ ] Onboarding wizard with progress indicators
- [ ] User profile completion with ORCID data import
- [ ] Welcome dashboard customized by user role

**Technical Requirements:**
- Multi-step wizard component with form validation
- Email invitation system with secure token generation
- Profile management interface with ORCID API integration
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop onboarding

## Dependencies
**External Dependencies:**
- MongoDB Atlas cluster setup and configuration
- Google OAuth application creation and approval
- ORCID OAuth application registration
- Vercel project deployment and environment configuration

**Internal Dependencies:**
- None (this is the foundational epic)

## Risk Mitigation
**Primary Risk:** Authentication system complexity leading to security vulnerabilities or user experience issues.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use established NextAuth v5 patterns rather than custom authentication
- Implement comprehensive testing for all authentication flows
- Follow OWASP security guidelines for session management
- Gradual rollout with extensive user testing

**Rollback Plan:**
- Maintain database migration rollback scripts
- Feature flags for authentication methods
- Backup authentication method (email/password) as fallback

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 5 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security audit passed for authentication flows
- [ ] Performance testing confirms sub-200ms response times
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design tested and functional
- [ ] Documentation updated including setup and deployment guides
- [ ] Automated test coverage >90% for authentication code
- [ ] Production deployment successful with monitoring enabled

## Architecture Impact
This epic establishes the foundational patterns that all subsequent epics will build upon:
- Multi-tenant data access patterns
- Authentication middleware patterns  
- Permission-based UI component patterns
- tRPC procedure security patterns

## Estimated Timeline
**Duration:** 3-4 sprints (6-8 weeks)
**Team Size:** 2-3 developers + 1 security review

## Next Epic
Upon completion, Epic 2 (Publisher Management Platform) can begin, building upon the authentication and tenant infrastructure established here.
