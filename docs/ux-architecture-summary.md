const AcademicComponent = ({ 
  variant = 'default',
  accessibility = 'enhanced',
  branding = 'journal-aware',
  ...props 
}) => {
  // 1. Apply journal theming
  const { theme } = useJournalTheming();
  
  // 2. Enhance accessibility
  const { a11yProps } = useAcademicAccessibility(accessibility);
  
  // 3. Mobile responsiveness
  const { isMobile } = useResponsive();
  
  // 4. Performance optimization
  const { isVisible } = useIntersectionObserver();
  
  return (
    <div 
      className={`academic-component variant-${variant}`}
      style={theme.cssVariables}
      {...a11yProps}
