**Template Selection: T3 Stack + Enhanced Academic Publishing Features**

Based on the brief's requirements for Next.js 15, TypeScript, and comprehensive full-stack architecture, I recommend starting with the **T3 Stack** as the foundation with significant extensions:

- **Base:** T3 Stack (Next.js 15 + TypeScript + tRPC + Tailwind + NextAuth)
- **Enhanced for Academic Publishing:** Custom AI evaluation services, document processing, multi-tenant architecture
- **Platform-specific:** Optimized for Vercel deployment with Cloudflare R2 integration

**Rationale:** T3 Stack provides type-safe full-stack development with modern best practices, which aligns perfectly with Synfind's need for reliability and scalability in the academic publishing domain.
