# Synfind (ScholaryHub) Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• **Reduce submission-to-publication time by 50%+ (target: <45 days vs industry 90+)** through AI-powered automation and streamlined workflows, with 85%+ AI accuracy validation and transparent timeline visibility for all stakeholders
• **Generate $10M ARR within 3 years through hybrid revenue model:** platform subscriptions (80% base revenue) + credit-based service marketplace (20% growing to 40%) with target 200+ credits consumed per submission
• **Successfully migrate 500+ journals from legacy OJS systems by Year 3** with <30-day migration timeline, comprehensive data validation, and rollback procedures to ensure zero business disruption  
• **Achieve 95%+ customer retention rate** through superior user experience, predictable revenue streams, and comprehensive feature adoption across all stakeholder groups
• **Establish market leadership position with 3.3% market share** of $850M serviceable addressable market, providing 2-3x faster processing than established competitors while maintaining regulatory compliance

### Background Context

The academic publishing industry faces a critical integration problem: while valued at $25.2B globally, it operates with fragmented legacy systems that create 12-18 month publication timelines and force publishers to choose between expensive migrations and operational inefficiency. Root cause analysis reveals that publishers avoid modernization not due to cost alone, but because no solution offers both seamless migration paths and significant operational improvements that justify transition risks.

Current market leaders (ScholarOne, Editorial Manager) process submissions in 90-120 days using manual workflows, while OJS systems require dedicated IT resources for maintenance and customization. This creates a $850M market opportunity for mid-tier publishers (5-50 journals) seeking integrated solutions that combine modern AI capabilities, service marketplaces, and proven migration methodologies.

Synfind's Next.js 15 full-stack platform addresses these fundamental challenges through three core differentiators: (1) purpose-built OJS compatibility enabling <30-day migrations, (2) AI-powered evaluation achieving target <45-day processing with 85%+ accuracy validation, and (3) credit-based service marketplace creating new revenue streams while improving manuscript quality. This integrated approach transforms academic publishing from a cost center into a competitive advantage for publishers while dramatically improving author and reviewer experiences.
